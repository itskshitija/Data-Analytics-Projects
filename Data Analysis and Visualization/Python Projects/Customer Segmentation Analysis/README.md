## Project Overview🔍
Customer Segmentation is a crucial business practice that involves grouping customers based on shared characteristics. This analysis leverages unsupervised machine learning to classify customers using behavioral and demographic data.

The insights help businesses:

- Target specific customer groups effectively.
- Enhance marketing strategies tailored to customer preferences.
- Boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Data Summary📂
The dataset comprises 2,000 customer records from an FMCG store, captured through loyalty card transactions. It includes 8 key features providing demographic and behavioral insights.

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| **ID**              | Unique identifier for each customer.                                                                     | Alphanumeric                           |  
| **Sex**             | Gender of the customer.                                                                                  | 0: Male, 1: Female                     |  
| **Marital Status**  | Marital status of the customer.                                                                          | 0: Single, 1: Non-Single               |  
| **Age**             | Age of the customer.                                                                                     | Integer (Years)                        |  
| **Education**       | Highest level of education attained.                                                                     | 0: Other, 1: High School, 2: University, 3: Graduate School |  
| **Income**          | Self-reported annual income (USD).                                                                       | Integer (e.g., 25000, 50000, 75000)    |  
| **Occupation**      | Customer’s job category.                                                                                 | 0: Unemployed, 1: Skilled, 2: Management/Self-Employed |

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)🔍
1️⃣ <b>Age Distribution:</b>
- Visualized the age spread of customers across different regions.

2️⃣ <b>Income Patterns:</b>
- Analyzed income disparities based on education and occupation.

3️⃣ <b>Gender Segmentation:</b>
- Examined purchasing patterns for male and female customers.

4️⃣ <b>Regional Insights:</b>
- Compared settlement sizes to identify trends in small, mid-sized, and big cities.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms 🤖
🔹 <b>Hierarchical Clustering:</b>
- Groups customers into a dendrogram structure to reveal natural clusters.
- Provides insights into similar customer segments.

🔹 <b>K-Means Clustering:</b>
- Partition-based algorithm for segmenting customers into ‘K’ distinct clusters.
- Ideal for identifying prominent customer groups with similar spending habits.

🔹 <b>PCA (Principal Component Analysis):</b>
- Reduces dataset dimensions while retaining maximum variance.
- Simplifies data visualization and improves clustering accuracy.

## Results and Insights☀️
<b>1. Key Clusters Identified:</b>
- High-income customers in big cities with graduate-level education.
- Budget-conscious customers from small cities.
- Mid-income customers prefer mid-sized cities.

<b>2.Demographic Breakdown:</b>
- Majority of the customers are aged between 25-45 years.
- Females showed a higher representation in the high-income segment.

<b>3.Regional Insights:</b>
- Big cities contribute to 60% of high-value purchases, while small cities show a preference for budget-friendly options.

<b>4. Education and Spending Patterns:</b>
- Graduate school customers demonstrated higher annual spending, while high school graduates leaned towards cost-efficient products.

## Conclusion
The segmentation revealed actionable insights for tailoring marketing strategies, such as:

- Launching premium product campaigns for high-income clusters.
- Promoting value-based offerings in small city segments.
- Designing personalized loyalty programs for mid-income customers.

These findings empower businesses to drive customer-centric growth strategies and ensure sustainable profitability.
