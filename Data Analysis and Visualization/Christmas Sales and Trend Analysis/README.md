## ✅Summary of Insights 

- Sales volume tends to experience a significant increase during Christmas, driven by a surge in demand for gifts, holiday promotions, and seasonal shopping. The festive period brings heightened consumer activity as people indulge in purchasing gifts for loved ones, take advantage of special offers, and fulfill holiday-related needs. Additionally, the end-of-year shopping rush, along with extended sales events, contributes to a spike in sales figures

- Our analysis revealed that customers within the age group of 36-55 are the most likely to make purchases. This demographic demonstrates a strong buying propensity, likely influenced by factors such as financial stability, household responsibilities, and gift-giving habits during key occasions.

- Urban areas such as British Columbia, Nunavut, Ontario, Alberta, and Nova Scotia contribute the highest to sales volume. This trend can likely be attributed to their higher population density, greater economic activity, and elevated purchasing power.

- Promotions prove to be highly effective during Christmas, driving increased customer engagement and boosting sales. Seasonal discounts, bundled offers, and festive-themed marketing campaigns attract a larger audience and encourage higher spending. Limited-time deals and exclusive holiday offers create a sense of urgency, prompting customers to make quicker purchase decisions. By leveraging the festive spirit, businesses can maximize their reach and revenue through well-timed promotional strategies.

- During the Christmas season, toys, food, and electronics emerged as the most popular categories among customers. Toys remain a top choice due to gift-giving traditions, especially for children. Food items, including festive treats and gourmet products, see a surge in demand as people host gatherings and celebrate with special meals. Electronics also rank high, driven by holiday deals and the appeal of gifting gadgets and tech accessories. These categories consistently dominate seasonal shopping trends, reflecting consumer priorities during the festive period.

- Customer satisfaction slightly declines during Christmas due to high demand and longer delivery times compared to non-holiday periods.

- 50-51% of orders during Christmas include gift wrapping. 

- Express shipping gains popularity during Christmas; however, late deliveries often lead to a decline in customer satisfaction rates.

- Product return rates during Christmas often rise due to various factors, including receiving the wrong items, damaged goods, or gifts that do not meet the recipient's preferences or expectations. The high volume of orders during the festive season increases the likelihood of errors in packing and shipping. Additionally, gift exchanges are common during this period, leading to returns when items do not suit the recipient's needs.

- The rate of online ordering has been steadily increasing across all weather conditions, with a noticeable spike during rainy weather.
